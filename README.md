# TPF OS - RISC-V - Primary

At The Programming Foundation, we are in the initial stage of developing an operating system with a simple interface that runs on the open instruction set architecture, RISC-V.

This is the official GitHub repo for our operating system based on FreeBSD 13.0. This year, we were able to run it on RISC-V using QEMU.

It's very primitive at this point. We plan to provide a demo of the system running a window manager using QEMU's RISC-V emulation soon!

See port status at https://wiki.freebsd.org/riscv/ports

Last year, we showed a demo of the OS running on the x64 architecture.

We're also looking forward to take advantage of the LinuxÂ® Binary Compatibility layer. See https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/linuxemu.html

FreeBSD is an operating system used to power modern servers,
desktops, and embedded platforms. A large community has
continually developed it for more than thirty years. Its
advanced networking, security, and storage features have
made FreeBSD the platform of choice for many of the
busiest web sites and most pervasive embedded networking
and storage devices.
